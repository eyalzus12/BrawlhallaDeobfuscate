here's what i have so far:

**in regards to where it spawns**
in 2v2, if there are at least two item spawn locations, the game will pick the leftmost and rightmost ones
if the leftmost and rightmost are the same, it'll pick a different one deterministically
if there's only one item spawn location, both items will spawn in it
(it's also possible to define initial item spawns specifically for teams... which is never done)

*for the rest of the match, picking the spawn location is done like this:*
shuffle the array of item spawn locations (using the naive (biased) algorithm...).
the following item spawns will be by the order of the shuffled array.
for each location (item spawn locations are rectangles), a random point inside is picked.
once all item spawn locations have been used, the array is reshuffled.

**in regards to what is spawned:**
gadget and weapon spawning is handled separately.
the more an item type is currently out, the lower chance for it to be picked (weighted random).
the amount of players affects how much the item count matters. i THINK the more players the more less-spawned items are likely.
about-to-explode items like active bombs are not counted.

**in regards to how often it is spawned:**
the game will not spawn over `playercount+1` weapons
and over `(playercount/2)+1` gadgets 
delay between spawns increases the more items are spawned
and the last possible spawn has an additional delay bonus
gadgets have larger delays between spawns
